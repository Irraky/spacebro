After reading [setup](./setup.md) and [our first Spacebro
application](./starting.md), you are now ready to jump in the swimming
pool!

You know all the basics to use Spacebro.  
To leverage all the power of Spacebro you may be interested in the few
hints below:

## Spacebro UI

To see a reprensentation of how your apps are connected together, run
[spacebroUI](https://github.com/spacebro/spacebroUI).
This tool is pretty convenient to make connections too.

## Spacebro-client web

To run spacebro-client from a web page, check the example
[here](https://github.com/spacebro/spacebro-client/blob/master/example/browser-src/index.html)

## Spacebro-client with vue

We love [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), and we use it a lot together with
electron.  
We got you covered with a [project
generator](https://github.com/soixantecircuits/electron-vue) that includes [vue-spacebro-client](https://github.com/spacebro/vue-spacebro-client), a Vue.js component to easily use spacebro with [vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/intro.html)


Happy hacking! üë®‚Äçüîß
